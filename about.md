## Research
1. #### [Machine Learning DDoS Detection](https://github.com/Sibelius-6/DDoS-with-ML)

  Throughout this research, we applied several machine learning techniques on detecting attacks, classifying attacks and visualization.

2. #### [Unknotting Number & Colourings of Knots](https://www.sibeliusp.com/old/research/knots/)

  Currently, we have two posters for both of them, which has first 250 knots coloured displayed. Moreover, we used some multi-thread programs to find colourability classifications for big knots. Results can be found in the poster.

  See other posters in [caribou contests](https://cariboutests.com/posters.php).
