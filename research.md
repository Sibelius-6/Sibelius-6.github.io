---



## Interests
artificial intelligence, game theory, abstract algebra, mathematical physics, graph theory, combinatorial optimization, matroid theory, music theory and composition

## Past Works
### [Machine Learning DDoS Detection](https://github.com/Sibelius-6/DDoS-with-ML)
Throughout this research, we applied several machine learning techniques on detecting attacks, classifying attacks and visualization.

### [Unknotting Number & Colourings of Knots](https://www.sibeliusp.com/old/research/knots/)
Currently, we have two posters for both of them, which has first 250 knots coloured displayed. Moreover, we used some multi-thread programs to find colourability classifications for big knots. Results can be found in the poster.
